**TOOLS, ACCESSORIES, OPTIONS**

•	Wireless option: [[BLEBee v1.0.0 board|http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/bluetooth-bee-p-598.html]]  and iOS app [[BLExplr|https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blexplr/id524018027?mt=8]] designed by Dr. Michael Kroll. Also see the [[product page|http://www.mkroll.mobi/?page_id=1070]]; the [[BLEBee product forum|http://forum.mkroll.mobi/]], and; [[Safecast announcement|https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.628182673894097.1073741830.196772350368467&type=1]]. (Although BLE can talk to any Bluetooth 4.0, the BLExplr iOS apps work only in BLE-enabled apple devices. Similarly the Safecast Geigerbot is only in iOS.)

•	FTDI breakout board 3.3V, for example this [[one| https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9873]] or that [[one|https://www.adafruit.com/products/284]] for loading firmware upgrades. See the Nano wiki page [[How to setup build environment on Mac OS X|https://github.com/Safecast/bGeigieNanoKit/wiki/How-to-setup-build-environment-on-Mac-OS-X/_edit]].

•	Pocket AVR Programmer for technical users who might want to program the Nano firmware. See the  [“Setup System on Mac OS X”](https://github.com/Safecast/SafecastBGeigie “Setup System on Mac OS X”) on the [[bGeigie README.md|https://github.com/Safecast/SafecastBGeigie]].

**EXTRAS, POSSIBLE OPTIONS ? GPS antenna option ? additional environmental sensors on the BZee socket (instead of the BLEBee), i.e. noise level; air quality chemistry; meterologic barometry, humidity, temperature, etc. ? Safecast has experimented with various uses and formats of the bGeigie series. (i.e. underwater, helicopter drone born, long-life stationary). Consult the devices group about your possible customization -- modular XBee socket, specialized data log formats, programming etc

Reportedly all Nano parts are separately available from suppliers.
