## Assembly ideas and guide 
### bGeigie Nano assembly instructions, v5a 
Congratulations on obtaining a SAFECAST bGeigie Nano kit. This high-performance geiger counter with GPS logging and memory has been developed by SAFECAST volunteers and thoroughly tested in the Ô¨Åeld. We're happy to be able to make it available in kit form for radiation enthusiasts everywhere to build on their own. 
Depending in your skill and experience level, assembly should take about 3-4 hours. We've tried to anticipate possible bumps and snags along the way, and have tempted to make these instructions as helpful as possible for novices. So if it seems like we're explaining the obvious from time to time, that's why. If you're very experienced at assembling electronic devices, feel free to modify the order of the steps.Docs, including the schematic, parts list, and a copy of these instructions as well as the user's manual will be downloadable soon from: www.safecast.org

### BEFORE YOU START: 
The LND7317 pancake sensor looks robust but is very delicate! Please handle it carefully! It has a thin mylar covering on one face, and inside is a partial vacuum. The mylar is easily punctured, rendering the tube useless. Since it's the single most expensive component, it would be a shame to trash it. May we recommend that you leave it in the box until you're ready to attach it? (That would be step D...) 

### WARNINGS: 
Solder iron should be 200-350 degrees Celsius 400-650 degrees Fahrenheit?]We hate to be a nanny, but smoke from solder is dangerous for your health, so work in a well-ventilated area please.Wear safety glasses when cutting off leads. They become needle-like projectiles that could blind you or your cat.Many of the small components are not very robust, and it's possible to yank the wire leads out accidentally. 
### Essential Tools: 
-- soldering iron or gun-- solder 60/40-- screwdriver (small Phillips-head/plus)-- needle-nosed pliers-- nippers (for cutting component leads)-- double-sided foam tape
